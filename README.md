ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS:

Tool Used : IntelliJ IDEA

Server : 
The server acts as a central hub where all clients connect. It listens for incoming client connections on a specific port. Upon a successful connection, it assigns a thread to handle the communication with each client. It broadcasts messages received from one client to all connected clients. 

Client:
Each client connects to the server using its IP address and port. Clients can send messages to the server. Clients also listen for broadcast messages from the server. 

Multithreading:
The server uses a separate thread for each connected client to ensure that all clients can communicate without delays or blocking other clients. Threads allow simultaneous message handling, enabling real-time interaction.
